## 💡 What is KamenRun?

KamenRun is a simple yet powerful running schedule tracker web app designed to help beginners achieve their running goals. The name "Kamen" has a dual meaning - it can be interpreted as "common" (for everyday people) or "come on" (as motivation to get started).

## 📖 The Story Behind KamenRun

This project was born from a personal challenge: **completing a half marathon in just one year with zero running experience and no coach**. As a busy daily worker, I wanted to prove that with the right guidance and consistent training, anyone can achieve their running dreams.

## 👨‍⚕️ Expert-Backed Training Plans

While I didn't have access to a personal coach, the training recommendations in KamenRun are based on expert advice from **Dr. Tirta** and **Coach Latief Nurarifin**'s comprehensive podcast. Their insights have been carefully summarized and organized with the help of Google Gemini AI to create accessible, beginner-friendly training schedules.
